# AI usage

AI tools were used as a support during this coding task.

The AI was primarily used for:

- Clarifying the task requirements and expected scope
- Discussing component structure and state ownership
- Getting feedback on UX decisions (validation timing, empty states, action hierarchy)
- Refining TypeScript typings and React patterns
- Improving code readability and consistency
- Drafting and refining documentation (README)

All application logic, structure, and final implementation decisions were made and reviewed manually.  
The AI was used as a reasoning and review aid, not to generate a complete solution.

No code was copied blindly; all suggestions were adapted to fit the intended design and constraints of the task.
